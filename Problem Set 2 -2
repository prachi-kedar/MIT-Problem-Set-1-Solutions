'''
write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.

In this problem, we will not be dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate.

The following variables contain values as described below:

balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card

annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will pay off all debt in under 1 year, for example:

Lowest Payment: 180 

'''


lower = balance / 12.0
upper = balance * (1 + annual / 12.0) ** 12 / 12
fixed = (lower + upper) / 2.0

while True:
    remain = balance
    for i in range(1, 13):
        remain = (remain - fixed) * (1 + annual / 12.0)
    if remain > 0:
        lower = fixed
    elif remain <= 0 and remain >= -0.01:
        break
    else:
        upper = fixed
    fixed = (lower + upper) / 2.0
