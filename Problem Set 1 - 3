 Problem 3

Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. 
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

"""

ax_length = 0
current = s[0]
longest = s[0]

for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if s[i+1] >= s[i]:
        current += s[i+1]
        if len(current) > max_length:
            max_length = len(current)
            longest = current
    else:
        current = s[i+1]
    i += 1
print("The longest substring in alphabetical order is:" + longest)
